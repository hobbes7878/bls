    <h1>Deadly Work</h1>
        <p>For each state, <em>The News</em> calculated the expected number of on-the-job deaths based on each industry's national fatality rate and the number of workers in the state working in that industry. The difference between the expected number of deaths in each state and industry and the actual number of deaths is the number of deaths over- or under- expected.</p>

        <p>Select a state to see how many deaths it was over or under for each industry sector. Hover over each sector to see which five industries had the highest percent of over-expected deaths.</p>

        <h1>Right-to-Work</h1>
         <p><em>The News</em> compared each state's total expected deaths across all industries to each state's actual death total. State's where the actual deaths were above the expected deaths tended to be right-to-work states, and state's where the actual deaths were below the expected deaths tended to be closed-shop states.</p>
